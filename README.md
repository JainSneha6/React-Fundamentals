# Basic React Project

This project is a simple React application designed to help you learn the basics of React, including components, JSX, props, states, conditional rendering, and dynamically outputting lists.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JainSneha6/React-Fundamentals.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd React-Fundamentals
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Open your browser and go to:
    ```
    http://localhost:5173
    ```

## Key Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be defined as classes or functions. 

### JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows you to write HTML directly within React.

### Props

Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another.

### State

State is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.

### Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in React allows you to render different components or elements based on a condition.

### Lists

You can dynamically output lists in React using the `map()` function.
