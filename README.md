## Key Concepts 

**Components** : Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be defined as classes or functions. 

**JSX** : JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows you to write HTML directly within React.

**Props** : Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another.

**State** : State is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.

**Conditional Rendering** : Conditional rendering in React allows you to render different components or elements based on a condition.

**Lists** : You can dynamically output lists in React using the `map()` function.
